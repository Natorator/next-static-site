## Welcome, developers!

jambonz is an open-source CPaaS platform that is primarily designed for use by communications service providers.  

As an API-driven platform, you will primarily interface with it using [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/overview/) and [REST APIs](/docs/rest/overview/).  Our client SDKs include a [Node.js SDK]() SDK as well as [Node-RED plugins]().  

There are two ways to run jambonz:
- use our hosted platform (you can [create a free account](https://jambonz.us/register)), or
- self-host your own jambonz system using the open-source distribution.

> Pro tip: Start by creating a free account on the hosted platform because you can start testing immediately without going through a build/install process or having to allocate any compute/network/storage resources. You can always migrate your applications seamlessly to a self-hosted platform later.

In these  pages you will find information about our SDKs and APIs, along with some useful tips for [Getting Started]() on the hosted platform, [tutorials]() describing how to perform common tasks, as well as some quick [how-to videos]().

As always, if you can't find the information you are looking for, please email us at support@jambonz.org and we'll be glad to help!
