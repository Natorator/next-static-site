## Welcome, developers!

jambonz is an open source CPaaS platform that is primarily designed for use by communications service providers.  As an API-driven platform, you will primarily interface with it using [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks/overview/) and [REST APIs](/docs/rest/overview/).  Our client SDKs include a [Node.js SDK]() SDK as well as [Node-RED plugins]().  

There are two ways to get started with jambonz:
- create a free account on our hosted platform, or
- download and install a jambonz system on your own infrastructure.
A good idea is to start by creating a free account on the hosted platform. Then, based on your testing and traffic needs, you can bring up a jambonz cluster on your own infrastructure and migrate your applications seamlessly. 

In these  pages you will find information about our SDKs and APIs, along with some useful tips for [Getting Started]() on the hosted platform, [tutorials]() describing how to perform common tasks, as well as some quick [how-to videos]().

As always, if you can't find the information you are looking for, please email us at support@jambonz.org and we'll be glad to help!
