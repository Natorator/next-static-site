# jambonz

jambonz is a CPaaS that is designed for communications service providers.  As an API-driven platform, you will primarily interface with it using [Webhooks]() and [REST APIs]().  

jambonz is available for use both as cloud APIs, or as an open source platform that you can run on your own infrastructure.  Either way, your applications are written in the same fashion, so you can start off by using the cloud APIs and later migrate to running your own platform if you like. 

jambonz is also a "Bring Your Own Everything" (BYOE) CPaaS, meaning that you will [plug in your own SIP trunking providers](), and [use your own AWS or Google credentials]() for speech processing. 

Follow the [Getting Started]() pages that follow to get yourself up and running on the cloud platform, or dive into the [API Reference]() or examine [client SDKs]() and [sample applications]() for inspiration.
